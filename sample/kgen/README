This is the README file for the library generator. 
Use the script file rungen.sh to generate any library.

It has two phases: 
   1. Tuning phase: When you want to find best K (dim) for register blocking, 
      use k as compile time or kruntime=0. Based on the value SDIM 
      (starting dimension), EDIM (ending dimension) and VLEN (SIMD width), 
      it will generate kernels, header and makefile for compile-time K 
      (without any rolled loop). 
   
   sample command (for AVX512): 
      ./rungen.sh -p s -v 16 -s 16 -e 256 -i 64 -t 18 -r bacrb -k 0

   2. Kruntime: To make it work for all K (dim), use bestK value (found from 
      tuning) and use kruntime=1 to create the library. It will generate unrolled
      kernels for K < bestK and partial unrolled (upto bestK) for all K > bestK

   sample command (for AVX512): 
      ./rungen.sh -p s -v 16 -s 16 -e 256 -i 64 -t 18 -r bacrb -k 1 -b 128 

Please run ./rungen.sh --help to get idea about all options.
